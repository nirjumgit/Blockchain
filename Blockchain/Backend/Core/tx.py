        What is serialized transaction?
        A serialized transaction is a binary representation of a Bitcoin transaction that can be transmitted over the network
        and stored in the blockchain. It contains all the necessary information about the transaction, including the inputs, outputs, and other metadata.
        The serialized transaction is used to create a unique transaction ID (txid) that can be used to reference the transaction in the blockchain.
        The serialization format is defined by the Bitcoin protocol and is used to ensure that transactions are consistent
        across different implementations of the protocol.

        Why is it important to serialize a transaction?
        Serializing a transaction is important because it allows the transaction to be transmitted over the network and stored in the blockchain in a standardized format.
        This ensures that all nodes in the network can understand and validate the transaction, regardless of the implementation of the Bitcoin protocol they are using.
        Additionally, the serialized transaction is used to create a unique transaction ID (txid) that can be used to reference the transaction in the blockchain.

        Instead, it creates new bitcoins out of thin air and assigns them to the miner's address as a reward for their work in securing the network.
        The coinbase transaction also includes a special script called the "coinbase script" that contains arbitrary data, such as the block height and extra nonce,
        which can be used to generate unique hashes for the block.
